#Exercise 16 Write a Python program to get the difference between a given number and 17, if the number is greater than 17 return double the absolute difference.

givennumber = 17
newnumber = raw_input("Give me random number:")

difference = int(givennumber) - int(newnumber)

	greaterdiff = abs(difference)
	print "\n", "The difference is:", greaterdiff * 2
else:
	print "\n", "The difference is:", difference

#Exercise 18 Write a Python program to calculate the sum of three given numbers, if the values are equal then return thrice of their sum.

number1 = raw_input("Give me first number")
number2 = raw_input("Give me second number")
number3 = raw_input("Give me third number")

else:
    print "\n", "The sum is", sumofnumbers

#Exercise 19 Write a Python program to get a new string from a given string where "Is" has been added to the front. If the given string already begins with "Is" then return the string unchanged.

givensentence = raw_input("Give me a sentence")

if givensentence.startswith("Is"):
    print "\n", givensentence
else: 
    newsentence = "Is " + givensentence
    print "\n", newsentence

#Exercise 21 Write a Python program to find whether a given number (accept from the user) is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. 

num = raw_input("Give me a number")
number = int(number)

if number%2 == 0:
    print "\n", number, " is an even number."
else:
